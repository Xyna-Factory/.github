## What is Xyna

Xyna Factory is an automation platform for graphically modeled workflows with a focus on network- / resource-related processes in carrier, provider and large enterprise networks. Invented and originally developed for large, demanding projects at Tier-1 service providers, Xyna was designed and implemented from the beginning with a large-scale and carrier-grade claim. Xyna is a generic platform from which various domain-specific applications can be derived: order management, service provisioning, self-service automation, network abstraction & activation, DHCP & ACS clusters, network intelligence & monitoring platforms â€“ and much [more](https://github.com/Xyna-Factory/xyna/wiki) .
