## Reporting Security Issues

We take security bugs seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.
To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory tab. We will send a response indicating
the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will  keep you informed of 
the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules or libraries to the person or team maintaining the module.
